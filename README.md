**Technologies:** React, Google Gemini AI, Bootstrap, clsx, react-confetti-boom, CSS

**Key Learnings:**
- **AI-Generated Content** - Using Google Gemini (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`) to generate random English words for each game round
- **Derived State** - Computing `wrongGuessedWordCount`, `isGameOver`, `isGameWon`, and `isLatestGuessWrong` from primary state rather than storing them separately
- **`clsx` for Conditional Classes** - Using the `clsx` utility for clean conditional CSS class application
- **`useEffect` for Side Effects** - Fetching AI-generated words on component mount

- Demonstrates React's built-in `useReducer` hook as a lightweight alternative to Redux
- A simple wallet with deposit/withdraw actions via a `moneyReducer`
- Pattern: `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)`

---

## Architecture & Routing

The entire application is orchestrated through a single `App.jsx` at the root that defines all routes using React Router v7's `createBrowserRouter`:

```
/                          → HappyDays (Landing/Navigation Hub)
/chief-mistral             → AI Recipe Generator
/reactfacts                → React Facts
/travel-journal            → Travel Journal
/meme-generator            → Meme Generator
/assembly-endgame          → Assembly EndGame
/tenzies-game/*            → Tenzies (auth-guarded)
  ├── /                    → Main Content (Game)
  ├── /login               → Login
  ├── /sign-up             → Sign Up
  └── /leaderboard         → Leaderboard
/vanslife/*                → VanLife
  ├── /                    → Home
  ├── /about               → About
  ├── /vans                → Vans List
  ├── /vans/:id            → Van Details
  ├── /login               → Login
  └── /host/*              → Host Dashboard (auth-guarded)
/moody/*                   → Moody
  ├── /login               → Login
  └── /home/*              → Home (Firebase auth-guarded)
      ├── /                → Moody Home
      ├── /post-feeds      → Feeds
      ├── /profile-update  → Profile Update
      └── /about           → About
```

**Cross-Cutting Patterns:**
- **Lazy Loading** - Nearly all route components are loaded via `React.lazy()` with `<Suspense>` fallback
- **`AnimatePresence`** - Wraps the `RouterProvider` for animated route transitions
- **Redux Provider** - Global Redux store wrapping at the root level in `main.jsx`
- **Firebase Configuration** - Centralized Firebase config in `src/config/firebaseConfig.js` shared across Moody, Tenzies, and VanLife

## Key Learnings & Overall Insights

### Progressive Complexity
The projects are structured in increasing complexity - from static pages (React Facts) to fully authenticated, AI-integrated applications (Moody, Tenzies). This progression naturally builds competence in:

1. **Component Design** - From simple presentational components to compound component patterns and render delegation
2. **State Management Evolution** - Local state (`useState`) → `useReducer` → Context API → Redux → Redux Toolkit with async thunks
3. **Data Fetching Patterns** - Inline `fetch()` → `useEffect` side effects → React Router loaders → Redux async thunks
4. **Authentication Depth** - Mock authentication (MirageJS) → Firebase email/password → Google OAuth → Route-level guards

### React Fundamentals Reinforced Across Projects
- **Props & Component Communication** - Every project reinforces different prop-passing patterns (direct, spread, context, outlet context)
- **Hooks Mastery** - Comprehensive use of `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useSearchParams`, `useFetcher`, `useLoaderData`, `useActionData`, `useNavigation`
- **Conditional Rendering** - Ternary operators, short-circuit evaluation, and early returns
- **List Rendering** - `.map()` with keys in Travel Journal, Tenzies dice, Moody posts, VanLife vans
- **Form Handling** - Controlled inputs, `FormData` API, `useFetcher` submissions, Ant Design modals
- **Side Effects** - API calls, DOM manipulation, scroll behavior, timers, and cleanup functions

### Advanced Concepts Demonstrated
- **AI Integration** - Two projects integrate LLM APIs (Google Gemini for word generation, Hugging Face Mistral for recipe generation)
- **Real-Time Backend** - Firebase Firestore for persistent data across Tenzies and Moody
- **Animation Systems** - Framer Motion for page transitions, parallax scrolling, drag interactions, and cursor-following effects
- **Performance Optimization** - `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, lazy loading, and code splitting
- **Accessibility** - `aria-*` attributes, `aria-live` regions, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Route Architecture** - Nested layouts, route guards, loader/action patterns, error boundaries, and deferred data with `Suspense`/`Await`

### Design Patterns Encountered
- **Compound Components** - Tenzies (`Tenzies.Login`, `Tenzies.MainContent`) and Moody's Menu system
- **Provider Pattern** - Context providers for Meme Generator and MealsList
- **Render Props / Children Pattern** - Layout components using `{children}` and `<Outlet />`
- **Custom Hooks** - `useMemeDataContext`, `useMealsList`, `requireFirebaseAuth`, `requireAuth`
- **Lazy Loading** - `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` for code-split route components
